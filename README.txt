Project Tic tac toe
by Kristian Damsgaard.


Known errors:

None. Game is compilable and tested as well as I have been able on my own.


Missing features:

None.


Required OS:

The game should run on windows, linux and MacOS.


Installation and execution:

Install a c++ compiler (I suggest minGW as it is easiest and light-weight).
Open command prompt/terminal.
Navigate to folder containing source code (kkd_tictactoe.cpp).

For windows:
Type "g++ kkd_tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe.exe".

For linux/MacOS:
Type "g++ kkd_tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe.out".

To execute write "tictactoe.exe" for windows or "./tictactoe.out" for linux/mac.

Alternatively, write "g++ kkd_tictactoe.cpp" and then a.exe for windoes, ./a.out for linux/mac

You can also run the executables included.
